This repository presents a CKEditor 5 editor build generated by the [Online builder tool](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder). Use this repo to rebuild the ckeditor.js configuration file used on the [policies site](https://github.com/UMD-Digital/policies/tree/master/source/files/static/ckeditor)

### Installation

```
npm install
```

### Adding or removing plugins

Now you can install additional plugin in the build. Follow the [Adding a plugin to an editor tutorial](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/installing-plugins.html#adding-a-plugin-to-an-editor)

### Rebuilding editor

Rebuild the editor by running the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will build the CKEditor 5 to the `build` directory. You can open your browser and you should be able to see the changes you've made in the code. If not, then try to refresh also the browser cache by typing `Ctrl + R` or `Cmd + R` depending on your system.
